Running programs on the MIPS 32 Processor 

In test benches
-- Load a program from a specific memory address
-- Initialize PC with the starting address of the program
-- The program starts executing, and will continue to do so until the HLT instruction is encountered. 
-- We can print the results from the memory locations or the registers to verify the operations.
